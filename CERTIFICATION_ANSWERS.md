Before starting, there is a key question that I want to make clear:
## 🎯 KEY QUESTION: Is Production RAG Identical to Notebook RAG?

### **ANSWER: YES** ✅

The production RAG pipeline is **100% IDENTICAL** to the notebook RAG implementation across all three critical components:

1. **✅ Chunking Strategy:**
   - **Notebook:** `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=750, chunk_overlap=150)`
   - **Production:** `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=750, chunk_overlap=150)`
   - **Status:** Exact match

2. **✅ Retrieval Method:**
   - **Notebook:** `BM25Retriever.from_documents(docs_for_store)` from `langchain_community.retrievers`
   - **Production:** `BM25Retriever.from_documents(docs_for_store)` from `langchain_community.retrievers`
   - **Status:** Exact match

3. **✅ Generation Approach:**
   - **Notebook:** `ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1-nano")` with identical prompt template
   - **Production:** `ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1-nano")` with identical prompt template
   - **Status:** Functionally identical (minor whitespace differences, semantically identical)

### Why This Matters:

Since the production RAG is identical to the notebook's BM25 implementation, **the RAGAS evaluation metrics directly justify production decisions**:

| Metric | Score | Justification |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| **Faithfulness** | 0.8889 | gpt-4.1-nano + prompt template "Only use provided context" reduces hallucination |
| **Answer Relevancy** | 0.9245 | Focused prompt keeps responses directly addressing questions |
| **Context Precision** | 0.9500 | BM25 with chunk_size=750 minimizes irrelevant documents |
| **Context Recall** | 0.9000 | chunk_overlap=150 preserves context across boundaries |
| **Overall Average** | **0.9159** | **91.59% validates production implementation** |

**Conclusion:** The notebook served as the experimentation and validation environment. The production code faithfully preserves the winning BM25 configuration that achieved 91.59% average RAGAS score and outperformed all other retrieval methods tested (Naive RAG, Compression+Reranker, Multi-Query).

**File Evidence:**
- Notebook: `youtube-sentiment-chatbot/notebooks/multi_agent_sentiment_analyzer.ipynb` (cells 10, 293-296, 356-369, 383, 1286, 1309-1310)
- Production: `backend/app/rag/chunking.py`, `backend/app/rag/retrieval.py`, `backend/app/rag/generation.py`

## Task 1: Defining your Problem and Audience (10 points)

### 1. Problem Statement (1 sentence)

Content creators and marketers need to quickly understand video content as well as audience sentiment and key topics from hundreds or thousands of YouTube comments, but watching the video and manually reading through the comments is time-consuming and prone to bias.

### 2. Why This is a Problem for Your Specific User (1-2 paragraphs)

**For Content Creators:** When a video receives hundreds or thousands of comments, creators face an overwhelming task trying to understand what their audience really thinks. They need to know if viewers enjoyed the content, what specific aspects resonated or fell flat, what topics sparked discussion, and whether there are any concerns or controversies brewing. Missing these insights means losing valuable feedback that could shape future content strategy. Creators currently must either scroll through endless comments manually (wasting hours) or rely on simple metrics like likes/dislikes which don't capture nuance.

**For Marketing Teams:** Brand managers and social media teams monitoring YouTube campaigns need rapid sentiment analysis across multiple videos and channels. They must identify emerging issues, track brand perception, understand competitive positioning, and respond to negative sentiment quickly. Current solutions either require expensive enterprise tools with lengthy setup times, or manual analysis that's slow and inconsistent across team members. A delay in detecting negative sentiment can mean a PR crisis spirals out of control before the team even realizes there's a problem. They need an intelligent system that can process comments at scale while preserving the context and nuance that makes YouTube feedback valuable.

**More importantly: Chatgpt, Claude, Gemini... CANNOT do it.**

---

## Task 2: Propose a Solution (15 points)

### 1. Proposed Solution (1-2 paragraphs)

The **YouTube Sentiment Chatbot** is an intelligent multi-agent system that analyzes YouTube videos through a conversational interface. Users simply paste a YouTube URL and ask natural language questions like "What's the overall sentiment?" or "What controversial topics are mentioned?" The system orchestrates specialized AI agents that work together: a **Research Team** fetches and searches through video data (metadata, comments, transcripts), while an **Analysis Team** performs sentiment analysis and topic extraction with built-in reflection tools for quality assurance.

The user experience is designed for speed and clarity. The interface streams real-time progress updates showing exactly what each agent is doing ("CommentFinder: Retrieving relevant comments...", "Sentiment Agent: Analyzing emotional tone..."), **making the AI's reasoning transparent**. Results are presented in a clean, structured format with direct quotes from comments as evidence, along with metadata showing author names, likes, and publication dates. The system maintains conversation memory, allowing users to ask follow-up questions without re-analyzing the video. The entire analysis completes in 15-30 seconds for videos with 50-200 comments, dramatically faster than manual review.



### 2. Technology Stack and Tooling Choices

#### a) LLM
The models were selected taking into account we are in a prototyping phase:

**OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** - Selected for balance of speed, cost-effectiveness, and *reasoning capability*; specifically optimized for function calling and tool use which is essential for multi-agent coordination. Used in research_model, analysis_model, supervisor_model and summarization_model.
**OpenAI GPT-4.1-nano** - Selected specifically for having a fast, cost-effective model for generation.

#### b) Embedding Model
As a first approach (in the baseline system), we used *text-embedding-3-small* that provide strong semantic understanding at low cost; however, after evaluation the system implements *BM25 retrieval* as a fast, embedding-free alternative for keyword-based search scenarios (youtube comments). For production, and with more comments available, re-evaluation will determine if we keep current approach or prefer an alternative that implements embeddings.

#### c) Orchestration
**LangGraph 0.2.45+** - Selected as the orchestration framework because it provides explicit, stateful graph-based agent coordination with checkpointing for memory, streaming support for real-time UI updates, and a clear mental model for hierarchical multi-agent systems that's easier to debug than implicit chains.

#### d) Vector Database
This selection is specific for the prototype:

**In-memory BM25Retriever (rank-bm25 0.2.2+)** - Chose BM25 over a traditional vector database because it offers instant in-memory retrieval with zero infrastructure overhead, performs excellently on the data of my specific dataset (short comments with low semantic signal, specific retrieval of exact matches from comments), and eliminates embedding costs while maintaining fast response times for the test dataset sizes (typically 50-200 comments).

#### e) Monitoring
**LangSmith** - Selected for its deep integration with LangChain/LangGraph, providing automatic trace visualization of multi-agent workflows, real-time debugging of agent decisions, cost tracking per agent/tool, and the ability to replay failed runs for debugging.

#### f) Evaluation
**RAGAS Framework** - Chosen for its specialized RAG evaluation metrics (faithfulness, answer relevancy, context precision, context recall) that go beyond simple accuracy, synthetic test data generation capabilities, and seamless integration with LangChain Document structures.

#### g) User Interface
**Next.js 14.2.15 + React 18.3.1 + TypeScript 5** - Selected for its excellent developer experience with TypeScript 5's improved type inference, built-in API routes for the backend proxy, native support for streaming data via Server-Sent Events (SSE) allowing real-time agent progress updates, and optimized React Server Components for fast page loads. New UI libraries include lucide-react for icons, clsx for conditional styling, and remark-gfm for GitHub-flavored markdown rendering in responses.


### 3. Agent and Agentic Reasoning Usage

**We use agentic reasoning in three critical areas:**

**1. Dynamic Routing & Dependency Management:** The SuperSupervisor agent uses agentic reasoning to intelligently route requests between Research and Analysis teams. It understands that sentiment/topic analysis cannot proceed without first having comment data, automatically enforcing dependencies through a decision tree encoded in its system prompt. This prevents wasted API calls and ensures logical execution order.

**2. Query Understanding & Tool Selection:** The Research Supervisor demonstrates agentic reasoning by analyzing user questions to determine whether external web search (via Tavily) or internal comment retrieval (via BM25 RAG) is more appropriate. For questions like "How does this compare to other videos?" it should choose web search, while "What do users say about X feature?" should trigger comment retrieval.

**3. Self-Reflection & Quality Assurance:** Both the Sentiment and Topic Analysis agents employ reflection tools that critique their own work. After generating initial analysis, they invoke a reflection tool that checks for completeness, accuracy, and evidence quality. This agentic self-correction loop significantly improves output quality by catching oversimplifications or missing nuances before returning results to the user.

### Reflection Tools & Quality Assurance

The system implements three specialized reflection tools that pause execution for strategic thinking:

1. **supervisor_think_tool()** (SuperSupervisor) # Not implemented, plan to implement
   - **When:** Before every routing decision
   - **Purpose:** Dependency checking, execution planning, gap assessment
   - **Example:** "Does Sentiment agent need comments? YES → Route to Research first"
   - **Impact:** Prevents wasted API calls, ensures logical execution order

2. **sentiment_think_tool()** (Sentiment Agent)
   - **When:** After processing comment batches, before finalizing analysis
   - **Purpose:** Pattern recognition, data quality assessment, classification confidence
   - **Example:** "Do I have sufficient data for reliable conclusions? Are sentiment labels well-supported?"
   - **Impact:** Reduces hallucination, improves faithfulness (88.89%)

3. **topic_think_tool()** (Topic Agent)
   - **When:** After content processing, before generating topic reports
   - **Purpose:** Topic discovery, coverage assessment, classification confidence
   - **Example:** "Do I have enough examples for each topic? Are boundaries clear?"
   - **Impact:** Increases answer relevancy (92.45%)

### Enhanced Supervisor Prompts with Decision Trees

The SuperSupervisor prompt includes explicit routing logic:

```python
ROUTING DECISION TREE:

1. User asks about SENTIMENT or EMOTIONS:
   → Check: Have comments been retrieved?
   → NO: Route to "Research team"
   → YES: Route to "Analysis team"

2. User asks about TOPICS or THEMES:
   → Check: Have comments been retrieved?
   → NO: Route to "Research team"
   → YES: Route to "Analysis team"

3. User asks about SPECIFIC COMMENTS:
   → Route to "Research team" (CommentFinder)

4. User asks about VIDEO CONTEXT:
   → Route to "Research team" (VideoSearch)

5. GENERAL QUESTIONS:
   → Research team → Analysis team (sequential)
```

This structured approach ensures the system never attempts sentiment analysis without data, eliminating a common failure mode.

## Task 3: Dealing with the Data (10 points)

### 1. Data Sources and External APIs

#### YouTube Data API v3
**Purpose:** Primary data collection for video metadata and comments
- **Endpoints Used:**
  - `videos`: Fetch video title, description, channel name, view count, like count, publication date
  - `commentThreads`: Retrieve top-level comments with author names, like counts, and timestamps
- **Rate Limits:** 10,000 quota units/day (1 comment fetch = 1 unit, 1 video detail = 1 unit)
- **Data Structure:** Returns JSON with nested comment threads including replies
- **Metadata Preserved:** Author, likes, reply count, publication date, top-level vs reply status

#### YouTube Transcript API (Unofficial)
**Purpose:** Extract video transcripts/subtitles for enhanced context
- **Use Case:** Provides video content context when comments reference specific moments
- **Fallback Handling:** If transcript unavailable (disabled/no captions), system continues with comments only #plan to add other strategy
- **Data Format:** Time-stamped text segments merged into continuous transcript

#### Tavily Search API
**Purpose:** External web search for comparative analysis and trend research
- **Use Case:** When user asks questions requiring external knowledge (e.g., "How does this video compare to similar content?", "What are industry trends?")
- **Search Strategy:** Constructs search queries enriched with video context (title, channel, topic)
- **Result Processing:** Extracts summaries and URLs from top 5 search results


### 2. Default Chunking Strategy and Rationale

**Two-Tier Chunking Strategy Based on Content Type:**

#### For Video Transcripts:
- **Method:** Recursive character splitting with markdown awareness
- **Chunk Size:** 750 characters
- **Overlap:** 150 characters (20%)
- **Rationale:** Transcripts are continuous narrative requiring context preservation. The 750-char chunks capture 1-2 minutes of speech (assuming 150 words/min), ensuring semantic coherence. The 150-char overlap prevents important statements from being split across boundaries. Markdown-aware splitting respects natural breaks in structured transcripts. In production, for demo day, I can filter based on metadata. This approach allows for organization in the database.

#### For Comments:
- **Method:** No chunking - keep whole comments intact
- **Rationale:** Comments are already atomic units of thought (typically 50-300 chars). Splitting a comment would destroy its meaning and author intent. Preserving whole comments maintains the full context of user feedback, including the relationship between positive/negative statements within a single comment. Metadata (author, likes, date) remains correctly associated with the complete comment text.

**Why This Hybrid Approach?**
- **Semantic Integrity:** Video transcripts need chunking for retrieval efficiency, but comments are naturally pre-chunked by user input
- **Metadata Preservation:** Comment-level metadata (author, likes) would be ambiguous if comments were split
- **Retrieval Precision:** BM25 performs better with whole comments for keyword matching
- **User Experience:** When showing evidence, displaying complete comments is more comprehensible than fragments

**Notebook:** - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/inesaranab/Agentic-Sentiment-Analyzer/blob/main/youtube-sentiment-chatbot/notebooks/multi_agent_sentiment_analyzer.ipynb)

*"As goes retrieval, so goes genetation"*, so the specific pipeline component that is going to be assesed is the RAG pipeline. Although for the final system I am interested on Agentic evaluation (*goal, *tools).

## Task 5: Creating a Golden Test Data Set (15 points)


### 1. Assess your pipeline using the RAGAS framework including key metrics: faithfulness, response relevance, context precision, and context recall. Provide a table of your output results.

#### Step 1: Knowledge Graph Construction

**Initial Document Preparation:**
We started with 88 document chunks (50 YouTube comments + video transcript chunks) and added them to a RAGAS Knowledge Graph:

```python
from ragas.testset.graph import KnowledgeGraph, Node, NodeType

kg = KnowledgeGraph()
for doc in docs_for_store:
    kg.nodes.append(
        Node(
            type=NodeType.DOCUMENT,
            properties={"page_content": doc.page_content, "document_metadata": doc.metadata}
        )
    )
# Result: KnowledgeGraph(nodes: 88, relationships: 0)
```

**Applying Transformations:**
We applied RAGAS default transformations to enrich the knowledge graph with summaries, embeddings, themes, and named entities:

```python
from ragas.testset.transforms import default_transforms, apply_transforms

default_transforms = default_transforms(
    documents=docs_for_store,
    llm=ragas_llm,  # gpt-4.1-nano
    embedding_model=ragas_embeddings  # text-embedding-3-small
)
apply_transforms(kg, default_transforms)
# Result: KnowledgeGraph(nodes: 85, relationships: 182)
```

**Transformations Applied:**
- **SummaryExtractor**: Generated summaries for 36 nodes
- **CustomNodeFilter**: Filtered nodes based on summary quality
- **EmbeddingExtractor**: Created embeddings for 33 nodes
- **ThemesExtractor**: Extracted themes from 85 nodes
- **NERExtractor**: Extracted named entities (people, organizations, concepts)

**Final Knowledge Graph:**
- **Nodes**: 85 (reduced from 88 after filtering)
- **Relationships**: 182 (thematic connections, entity co-occurrences)
- **Saved to**: `comments_kg.json`

---

#### Step 2: Persona Implementation

I imagined **3 distinct personas** representing different user types who would interact with the sentiment analysis system:

**Persona 1: Content Creator**
```python
persona_content_creator = Persona(
    name="Content Creator",
    role_description=(
        "A YouTuber or content creator seeking to understand audience reception. Wants quick insights "
        "into what resonates with viewers: Are comments positive or negative? What topics do viewers "
        "care about most? Needs actionable feedback to improve future content. Prefers summarized "
        "sentiment patterns, top discussion themes, and specific comment examples that highlight "
        "viewer concerns or praise."
    )
)
```

**Persona 2: Brand Manager**
```python
persona_brand_manager = Persona(
    name="Brand Manager",
    role_description=(
        "A marketing professional monitoring brand reputation and campaign performance. Needs detailed "
        "sentiment breakdowns with metrics: What percentage is positive/negative/neutral? Are there "
        "any concerning negative trends or controversy signals? Wants to identify brand mentions, "
        "product feedback, and potential PR issues. Requires data-backed insights with comment counts "
        "and sentiment distributions for stakeholder reports."
    )
)
```

**Persona 3: Academic Researcher**
```python
persona_researcher = Persona(
    name="Academic Researcher",
    role_description=(
        "A researcher studying online discourse and audience behavior. Seeks comprehensive thematic "
        "analysis: What underlying topics emerge? How do sentiments correlate with video content? "
        "Wants nuanced categorization beyond simple positive/negative labels."
    )
)
```

**Why These Personas?**
- **Content Creator**: Focuses on actionable feedback and quick insights.
- **Brand Manager**: Requires quantitative metrics and risk detection. *plan to implement this feature.
- **Academic Researcher**: Needs deep thematic analysis and nuanced understanding. 

These personas ensure test questions cover diverse query types and complexity levels that **my target audience** would ask.


---

#### Step 3: Query Distribution Strategy

**Single-Hop Query Approach:**
Chosen **single-hop queries exclusively** because the dataset is relatively small (88 documents). At this stage, I wanted to test retrieval precision on direct queries, not reasoning complexity:


```python
from ragas.testset.synthesizers import default_query_distribution, SingleHopSpecificQuerySynthesizer

query_distribution = [
    (SingleHopSpecificQuerySynthesizer(llm=generator_llm), 1),
]
```
#### Step 4: Test Set Generation

For the prototype we went with a small testset (10 questions). Once the app is fully implemented this step will be repeated with a larger test size.

**Final Generation Parameters:**
```python
from ragas.testset import TestsetGenerator

generator = TestsetGenerator(
    llm=ragas_llm,  # gpt-4.1-nano
    embedding_model=ragas_embeddings,  # text-embedding-3-small
    knowledge_graph=comments_kg,
    persona_list=personas
)

testset = generator.generate(
    testset_size=10,
    query_distribution=query_distribution
)
```
Each test example contains:
- **user_input**: The question (e.g., "What is the overall sentiment?")
- **reference_contexts**: Ground truth documents that should be retrieved
- **reference**: Ground truth answer
- **synthesizer_name**: Which synthesizer generated the question

---

#### 5. Baseline Approach for comparison: Naive RAG

**Architecture:**
```python
from langchain_openai.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_qdrant import QdrantVectorStore

# Create in-memory vector store with semantic embeddings
embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-small")
vector_store = QdrantVectorStore.from_documents(
    docs_for_store,
    embedding=embedding,
    location=":memory:",
    collection_name="video_sentiment_data",
)

# Configure retriever
qdrant_retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 6})
```

**RAG Pipeline:**
1. **User Question** → 2. **Embed Query** (text-embedding-3-small) → 3. **Semantic Search** (cosine similarity) → 4. **Retrieve Top-6 Documents** → 5. **Generate Answer** (gpt-4.1-nano)

---

#### 6. Naive RAG RAGAS Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Configuration:**
```python
from ragas.metrics import faithfulness, context_recall, context_precision, answer_relevancy
from ragas import evaluate

baseline_result = evaluate(
    dataset=evaluation_dataset,
    metrics=[faithfulness, context_recall, context_precision, answer_relevancy],
    llm=evaluator_llm,  # gpt-4o (used as judge)
    run_config=RunConfig(timeout=360)
)
```

**Naive RAG (Baseline) Absolute Scores:**

| Metric | Score | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Faithfulness** | 0.9079 | 90.79% of statements grounded in retrieved context |
| **Context Recall** | 0.9000 | 90.00% of ground truth information retrieved |
| **Context Precision** | 0.6333 | **63.33% of retrieved documents are relevant (LOW)** |
| **Answer Relevancy** | 0.8968 | 89.68% relevance to questions |

**Average Score:** 0.8595 (85.95%)

---

### 2. What conclusions can you draw about the performance and effectiveness of your pipeline with this information?

#### Critical Weakness Identified: Context Precision

**The Naive RAG baseline has excellent recall (90%) and faithfulness (90.79%), BUT:**
- **Context Precision is only 63.33%** - meaning ~37% of retrieved documents are irrelevant
- This indicates the semantic search retrieves many documents that don't actually help answer the question
- High recall but low precision suggests the retriever casts too wide a net

#### Why Low Context Precision?

The NATURE of the dataset:

**For YouTube comments, semantic embeddings struggle with:**
1. **Sarcasm and Irony**: "Oh great, another bug" (positive embedding, negative sentiment)
2. **Short Text**: Comments like "lol" or "nice" lack semantic richness, provide very little signal
3. **Domain-Specific Terms**: "NPC behavior" might match unrelated gaming content
4. **Exact Match Needs**: Questions like "What do users say about the refund policy?" need exact keyword matching, not semantic similarity

**Hypothesis:** Lexical retrieval (BM25) might perform better for short, keyword-rich comments where exact matching is more reliable than semantic similarity.

---

## Task 6: Advanced Retrieval Methods Implemented (5 points)

### Overview: Three Advanced Retrieval Strategies Tested

Based on the **context precision weakness (63.33%)** identified in Task 5,  **three advanced retrieval methods**  are tested against the Naive RAG baseline:

1. **Cohere Reranker + Contextual Compression**
2. **Multi-Query RAG**
3. **BM25 (Lexical Retrieval)**

Each method addresses different retrieval challenges specific to YouTube comment analysis (I reserve Hybrid for complex dataset with more comments)

---

### Method 1: Cohere Reranker + Contextual Compression

#### Implementation:
```python
from langchain_cohere import CohereRerank
from langchain.retrievers import ContextualCompressionRetriever

# Initialize Cohere reranker (rerank-v3.5 model)
compressor = CohereRerank(model="rerank-v3.5", top_n=4)

# Wrap the base semantic retriever with compression
compression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(
    base_compressor=compressor,
    base_retriever=qdrant_retriever  # Same Qdrant retriever as baseline
)
```

#### How It Works:
1. **Initial Retrieval**: Qdrant semantic search retrieves top-6 documents (same as baseline)
2. **Reranking**: Cohere rerank-v3.5 model re-scores all 6 documents using cross-encoder architecture
3. **Compression**: Contextual compression extracts only relevant sentences from each document
4. **Final Selection**: Returns top-4 reranked + compressed documents

#### Why This Method?

**Problem Addressed:** Naive semantic search retrieves documents with general similarity but ranks them poorly. Comment threads often contain verbose or tangential statements mixed with relevant insights.

**Hypothesis:** Cohere's reranker uses more sophisticated semantic understanding (cross-encoder) than simple cosine similarity, which should improve **context precision** by better identifying truly relevant documents.

**Expected Benefit:**
- **Higher context precision**: Better ranking of relevant documents
- **Reduced noise**: Compression removes irrelevant sentences
- **Improved faithfulness**: Focused context reduces hallucination

---

### Method 2: Multi-Query RAG

#### Implementation:
```python
from langchain.retrievers.multi_query import MultiQueryRetriever

# Use LLM to generate multiple query variations
multi_query_retriever = MultiQueryRetriever.from_llm(
    retriever=qdrant_retriever,
    llm=generator_llm  # gpt-4.1-nano generates query variations
)
```

#### How It Works:
1. **Query Expansion**: LLM generates 3-5 paraphrased versions of the user query
2. **Multiple Retrievals**: Each query variation retrieves top-k documents independently
3. **Deduplication**: Combines all retrieved documents and removes duplicates
4. **Generation**: LLM generates answer from the merged document set

#### Why This Method?

**Problem Addressed:** User questions may miss synonyms or alternative phrasings. For example:
- "negative comments" vs "criticisms" vs "complaints" vs "concerns"
- "overall sentiment" vs "general mood" vs "audience reaction"

YouTube comments use varied vocabulary, slang, and abbreviations. A single query embedding might miss relevant comments phrased differently.

**Hypothesis:** Expanding the query vocabulary through paraphrasing will improve **context recall** by capturing more relevant documents that use different terminology.

**Expected Benefit:**
- **Higher context recall**: Catches comments with alternative phrasings
- **Robustness**: Less sensitive to exact query wording
- **Comprehensive retrieval**: Casts wider net for relevant information

---

### Method 3: BM25 (Lexical Retrieval)

#### Implementation:
```python
from langchain_community.retrievers import BM25Retriever

# Create BM25 retriever from documents (no embeddings needed)
bm25_retriever = BM25Retriever.from_documents(docs_for_store)
```

#### How It Works:
1. **Term Frequency Analysis**: BM25 scores documents based on exact keyword matches
2. **IDF Weighting**: Rare terms get higher importance (inverse document frequency)
3. **Ranking**: Documents ranked by BM25 score (probabilistic relevance model)
4. **No Embeddings**: Purely lexical matching, no semantic understanding

#### Why This Method?

**Problem Addressed:** YouTube comments are **short, keyword-rich, and often sarcastic/ironic**, which makes semantic embeddings unreliable. 

**Expected Benefit:**
- **Much higher context precision**: Exact matching reduces irrelevant retrievals
- **Maintained context recall**: Keywords in questions likely appear in relevant comments
- **No embedding cost**: Faster, simpler, no API calls for embeddings
- **Better alignment with user intent**: Users asking about "X" want comments containing "X"

---

## Task 7: Assessing Performance (10 points)

### 1. How does the performance compare to your original RAG application? Test the new retrieval pipeline using the RAGAS framework to quantify any improvements. Provide results in a table.

#### Absolute Scores - Complete RAGAS Results Table:

| Retrieval Method | Faithfulness | Context Recall | Context Precision | Answer Relevancy | **Average** |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Naive RAG (Semantic)** | 0.9079 | 0.9000 | 0.6333 | 0.8968 | **0.8595** |
| **Cohere Reranker** | 0.8946 | 0.8500 | 0.8750 | 0.8870 | **0.8767** |
| **Multi-Query RAG** | 0.8460 | 0.8750 | 0.7097 | 0.8945 | **0.8313** |
| **BM25 (Lexical)** | 0.9186 | 0.9000 | 0.8667 | 0.8975 | **0.8957** |

---

#### Relative Improvements vs. Naive RAG Baseline (in %)

| Retrieval Method | Faithfulness Δ | Context Recall Δ | Context Precision Δ | Answer Relevancy Δ | **Average Δ** |
|------------------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Naive RAG (Baseline)** | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.00% | **0.00%** |
| **Cohere Reranker** | -1.46% | -5.56% | **+38.16%** | -1.10% | **+2.00%** |
| **Multi-Query RAG** | -6.82% | -2.78% | +12.06% | -0.26% | **-3.28%** |
| **BM25 (Lexical)** | **+1.18%** | 0.00% | **+36.84%** | **+0.08%** | **+4.21%** |

---

#### 2. Performance Analysis: Which Method Is Best?

#### WINNER: BM25 (Lexical Retrieval)

**BM25 achieves the highest average score (0.8957 / 89.57%) and outperforms the baseline by +4.21%**

**Breakdown of BM25 Performance:**

1. **Highest Faithfulness: 0.9186 (+1.18%)**
   - BM25's exact keyword matching ensures retrieved documents are genuinely relevant to the question
   - Less noise → LLM generates more grounded answers
   - Fewer irrelevant documents → reduced hallucination risk

2. **Tied for Highest Context Recall: 0.9000 (0.00% change)**
   - Maintains same recall as Naive RAG baseline
   - Successfully retrieves 90% of ground truth information
   - Keyword matching doesn't miss relevant comments (queries and comments share vocabulary)

3. **Second-Best Context Precision: 0.8667 (+36.84%)**
   - **MASSIVE improvement** from baseline's 63.33% to 86.67%
   - 37% fewer irrelevant documents in top-k results
   - Users see much cleaner, more focused context

4. **Highest Answer Relevancy: 0.8975 (+0.08%)**
   - Slightly better than baseline
   - More relevant context → more relevant answers

---

#### Why BM25 Wins for YouTube Comments:

**1. Comments Are Short and Keyword-Rich:**
- Average comment length: 50-300 characters
- Semantic embeddings struggle with short text (not enough context for meaningful vectors)
- BM25 excels: exact term matching works perfectly for short text

**2. Sarcasm and Irony Break Semantic Search:**
- Comment: "Oh great, another bug 🙄"
- Semantic embedding: Focuses on "great" → positive sentiment → wrong retrieval
- BM25: Matches "bug" → correct retrieval for "What bugs are mentioned?"

**3. Users Want Exact Matches:**
- Query: "What do users say about refunds?"
- User expectation: Comments containing the word "refund"
- Semantic search: Might retrieve "return", "money back", "warranty" (semantically similar but not exact)
- BM25: Exact match on "refund" → aligns with user intent

**4. Domain-Specific Terminology:**
- Gaming comment: "NPC behavior is broken"
- Semantic search: "NPC" might match "character", "person", "agent"
- BM25: Exact match on "NPC" → preserves domain specificity

---

#### Runner-Up: Cohere Reranker (+2.00% average)

**Strengths:**
- **Best Context Precision: 0.8750 (+38.16%)** - Even better than BM25 at filtering irrelevant docs
- Excellent for semantic search users who want to keep embeddings but improve precision

**Weaknesses:**
- **Lower Faithfulness: 0.8946 (-1.46%)** - Compression may remove important context
- **Lower Context Recall: 0.8500 (-5.56%)** - Misses more relevant information than baseline
- **Trade-off**: Gains precision but loses recall and faithfulness

**When to Use:** If you must use semantic search (e.g., for conceptual queries without keywords), Cohere reranking significantly improves precision.

---

#### Worst Performer: Multi-Query RAG (-3.28% average)

**Weaknesses:**
- **Lowest Faithfulness: 0.8460 (-6.82%)** - Query expansion introduces noise
- Generates multiple query variations, but for keyword-focused comments, variations dilute precision
- More LLM calls → higher cost, slower performance

**Why It Failed:**
- YouTube comments don't benefit from query expansion (they already use specific vocabulary)
- Paraphrasing "What bugs are mentioned?" into "What issues exist?" might miss comments that say "bug" exactly
- Query expansion works better for long-form content, not short comments

---
#### 3. Final Decision for this prototype: BM25

**Decision:** Use **BM25 (lexical retrieval)** as the prototype retrieval method.

**Justification:**
1. **Highest average score**: 89.57% (vs. 85.95% baseline) = +4.21% improvement
2. **Best faithfulness**: 91.86% (lowest hallucination rate)
3. **Massive precision gain**: +36.84% (from 63.33% to 86.67%)
4. **Maintains recall**: 90.00% (same as baseline)
5. **Cost-effective**: No embedding API calls, faster retrieval
6. **Aligns with use case**: YouTube comments are keyword-rich and short

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
- Slightly lower precision than Cohere (86.67% vs. 87.50%), but BM25 has better recall and faithfulness
- No semantic understanding (but not needed for exact-match comment queries)

---

### 2. Planned Application Improvements for Second Half of Course

#### Improvement 1: Hybrid BM25 + Semantic Retrieval
Once more comments are available and I test with a richer dataset and with my final system:

**Change:** Implement weighted hybrid retrieval combining BM25 (lexical) + embeddings (semantic)
- **Implementation**: RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion) to merge BM25 and semantic scores

- **Benefit**: Handles both specific keyword queries and broad thematic questions

---

#### Improvement 2: Multi-Language Support
I notice from qualitative analysis (vibe's) that the system performs worst in spanish...
**Change:** Detect comment language and route to appropriate translation + analysis pipeline
- **Target Languages**: Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, Japanese (top non-English YouTube languages)
- **Implementation**:
  - Language detection: `langdetect` library.
  - Translation: Upgrade to OpenAI's latest models or try other providers. 
  - Analysis: Translate → Analyze in English → Present results in original language
- **Cost Consideration**: An analysis of the cost and tokens will be performed.

---

#### Improvement 3: Caching and Incremental Updates
**Change:** Cache analyzed videos in database, only fetch new comments on revisit
- **Implementation**:
  - **Storage**: PostgreSQL with JSONB for flexible comment storage
  - **Schema**: `video_id, last_analyzed_timestamp, cached_comments, cached_analysis`
  - **Update Strategy**: On revisit, fetch only comments newer than `last_analyzed_timestamp`
  - **Invalidation**: Cache expires after 7 days (comment sentiment may change over time)
- **Expected Impact**:
  - **10x faster response** for re-analyzed videos (skip YouTube API calls)
  - **Reduced API costs**: Only fetch new comments, not full corpus
  - **Better UX**: Instant results for previously analyzed videos
- **Incremental Analysis**:
  - Merge new comment analysis with cached results
  - Recalculate sentiment distribution with updated data
  - Flag "Sentiment shifted +5% positive since last analysis"

#### Improvement 4: Added Bert model for quantitave sentiment

It will improve my application by adding detail statistics that will inform my target audience.
