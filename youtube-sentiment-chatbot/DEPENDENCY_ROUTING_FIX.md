# Dependency-Aware Routing Fix

## Problem Identified

When users asked questions like "What is the predominant sentiment in the comment section?", the system failed because:

1. **Supervisor routed directly to Analysis team** (Sentiment/Topic agents)
2. **Analysis agents don't have comments** - they can't retrieve data themselves
3. **CommentFinder was never called** to retrieve the comments first
4. **Agents responded with confusion** - "Please provide the comments..."

### Root Cause
The Supervisor lacked **dependency awareness** - it didn't understand that Analysis agents REQUIRE comments from the Research team before they can work.

---

## Solution Implemented

### ‚úÖ Architecture Decision
We use **prompt engineering** rather than tool-based orchestration because:
- Simpler implementation
- Faster execution (no extra tool calls)
- More deterministic routing
- LLM reasoning embedded in prompts

### ‚úÖ Changes Made

#### 1. Enhanced `supervisor_think_tool` (Reference)
**File:** `app/agents/analysis_tools.py`

Added comprehensive dependency checking guidance to the supervisor's reflection tool. While not directly callable in the current architecture, it serves as a blueprint for the prompt logic.

**Key additions:**
- Explicit dependency rules (sentiment/topic ‚Üí needs comments first)
- Execution sequence examples (`CommentFinder ‚Üí Sentiment`)
- Question pattern matching examples
- Mandatory "BEFORE routing" mental framework

#### 2. Enhanced `SUPER_SUPERVISOR_PROMPT`
**File:** `app/core/prompts.py`

Transformed from a generic routing prompt to a **dependency-aware orchestrator**:

**Before:**
```python
"You are a supervisor... respond with the worker to act next..."
```

**After:**
```python
"""You are the master supervisor coordinating specialized teams...

CRITICAL ROUTING RULES - DEPENDENCY AWARENESS:
‚ö†Ô∏è Analysis team agents REQUIRE comments to analyze.
If comments have not been retrieved yet, you MUST route to Research team FIRST.

ROUTING DECISION TREE:
1. Sentiment/emotions ‚Üí Check for comments ‚Üí Route accordingly
2. Topics/themes ‚Üí Check for comments ‚Üí Route accordingly
3. Specific comments ‚Üí Route to Research team
4. Video context ‚Üí Route to Research team
5. General questions ‚Üí Research first, then Analysis
"""
```

**Key features:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Explicit dependency warnings
- üå≥ Decision tree for common question types
- üîÑ Sequential execution pattern
- ‚úÖ Clear completion criteria

#### 3. Enhanced `SUPERVISOR_ROUTING_QUESTION`
**File:** `app/core/prompts.py`

Added structured analysis before routing:

**Before:**
```python
"Given the conversation above, who should act next? Select one of: {options}"
```

**After:**
```python
"""Based on the conversation above, perform this analysis:

1. DEPENDENCY CHECK: Does next step require unretrieved comments?
2. PROGRESS ASSESSMENT: What data do we have? What's missing?
3. ROUTING DECISION: Select one of: {options}
   - Research team: If need data retrieval
   - Analysis team: If have data, need analysis
   - FINISH: If comprehensively answered
"""
```

#### 4. Cleaned Up `supervisor.py`
**File:** `app/agents/supervisor.py`

- ‚ùå Removed broken import of `supervisor_think_tool`
- ‚ùå Removed tool from `bind_tools()` (was unusable due to `tool_choice` conflict)
- ‚úÖ Kept clean, deterministic routing mechanism
- ‚úÖ Prompts now handle the reflection logic

## How It Works Now

### Example: "What is the predominant sentiment in the comment section?"

#### Old Behavior (‚ùå Broken):
```
User: "What is the predominant sentiment?"
  ‚Üì
Supervisor: Routes to "Analysis team"
  ‚Üì
Topic Agent: "Please provide the specific comments..."
Sentiment Agent: "The sentiment analysis reflection has been recorded..."
  ‚Üì
‚ùå No actual analysis, confusion
```

#### New Behavior (‚úÖ Fixed):
```
User: "What is the predominant sentiment?"
  ‚Üì
Supervisor: Analyzes question ‚Üí "Sentiment requires comments"
            Checks history ‚Üí "No comments retrieved yet"
            Decision ‚Üí Route to "Research team" FIRST
  ‚Üì
Research Team:
  - CommentFinder: Retrieves relevant comments
  ‚Üì
Supervisor: Checks history ‚Üí "Comments now available"
            Decision ‚Üí Route to "Analysis team"
  ‚Üì
Analysis Team:
  - Sentiment Agent: Analyzes sentiment from retrieved comments
  ‚Üì
‚úÖ Complete, accurate analysis
```

## Testing the Fix

### Test Cases

1. **Sentiment Questions:**
   ```
   "What's the overall sentiment?"
   "How do people feel about this video?"
   "Are comments positive or negative?"
   ```
   **Expected:** Research team ‚Üí Analysis team ‚Üí Complete answer

2. **Topic Questions:**
   ```
   "What topics are discussed?"
   "What are the main themes?"
   "What do people talk about?"
   ```
   **Expected:** Research team ‚Üí Analysis team ‚Üí Complete answer

3. **Comment-Specific:**
   ```
   "Show me comments about X"
   "What do comments say about Y?"
   ```
   **Expected:** Research team ‚Üí Direct answer

4. **Video Context:**
   ```
   "What is this video about?"
   "Who is the creator?"
   ```
   **Expected:** Research team (VideoSearch) ‚Üí Answer

5. **Combined Questions:**
   ```
   "Give me a complete analysis"
   "What's the sentiment and main topics?"
   ```
   **Expected:** Research team ‚Üí Analysis team ‚Üí Comprehensive answer

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Dependency Awareness** üß†
Supervisor now understands which agents depend on others:
- Sentiment/Topic agents depend on CommentFinder
- Analysis requires Research data

### 2. **Sequential Execution** üîÑ
Ensures prerequisites are met:
- Research happens before Analysis
- Data retrieval before data processing

### 3. **Clear Decision Logic** üéØ
Supervisor has explicit rules:
- Pattern-based routing (sentiment ‚Üí research ‚Üí analysis)
- History checking (have we retrieved data?)
- Gap assessment (what's missing?)

### 4. **Graceful Handling** üõ°Ô∏è
If Analysis reports missing data:
- Supervisor routes back to Research
- Research gathers missing information
- Routing resumes to Analysis

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
- [ ] Add state inspection to verify comment availability programmatically
- [ ] Implement confidence scoring for routing decisions
- [ ] Add explicit "data manifest" tracking in state
- [ ] Create routing decision logs for debugging
- [ ] Add unit tests for routing logic

### Alternative Approaches Considered:
1. **Tool-based orchestration** - More complex, slower
2. **Hard-coded routing** - Less flexible, not LLM-native
3. **Two-phase supervisors** - Over-engineered for current needs
